 * Greedy approach is applicable in the condition:
	1) At every step we can make a choice that looks best at the moment
	2) We get the optimal solution of the complete problem
	
	Note: If a problem can be solved using Greedy algorithm, then that is the best possible solution to that problem
	However, not all the problems can be solved by the Greedy Algorithm
	For example, Fractional Knapsack can be solved using Greedy but 0-1 Knapsack can not be solved using Greedy
